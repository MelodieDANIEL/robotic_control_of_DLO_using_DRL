<br>We conducted extra trainings and testings than in the main paper. 
<br>We conducted training for controlling two mesh nodes, four mesh nodes, and six mesh nodes using the medium database. 
<br>For the testing phase, all the results are calculated for 1000 testing episodes with 20 steps, i.e., the robot can take a maximum of 20 actions to achieve the deformation. 
<br>We test the three trainings for an average distance error threshold of 0.05 m and 0.03 m. 
<br>We evaluate them using the medium and the large databases to extract the desired deformations. 
<br>We assess them finally with and without reinitializing the environment.
